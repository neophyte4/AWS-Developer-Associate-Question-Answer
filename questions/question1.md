## A developer is planning to use a Lambda function to process incoming requests from an Application Load Balancer (ALB). How can this be achieved?
1. Create a target group and register the Lambda function using the AWS CLI.
2. Create an Auto Scaling Group (ASG) and register the Lambda function in the launch configuration.
3. Setup an API in front of the ALB using API Gateway and use an integration request to map the request to the Lambda function.
4. Configure an event-source mapping between the ALB and the Lambda function.
